# Islam IsLIES â€” *let no one tell you otherwise*

- Faith in Jesus leads to Salvation
- Faith in Allah leads to lies 
- Faith in Mohammad leads to damnation


Showcasing the lies of Islam and the many lies that are taught by Satan through his prophet Mohammad that keeps people from being saved through having faith in Jesus Christ that He:

Died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins
was buried in the tomb for three days
but after the third day Jesus rose from the grave 
and is now at the Right Hand of the Father in Heaven. 

Jesus says when you believe in this gospel which is the power of God then you will never perish and have everlasting life through having faith in Him alone....

## Mission

Islam IsLIES exists to reveal Biblical truths about Islam and Jesus Christ through careful scriptural analysis and comparison. Our name reflects our commitment to examining what we believe are inconsistencies between Islamic teachings and Biblical revelation.


## Approach
We approach this sensitive topic through detailed examination of Biblical texts, historical context, and theological analysis. Our documents focus on:

The divinity of Jesus Christ as revealed in Scripture
Comparative analysis between Biblical teachings and Islamic claims
Examination of common misconceptions about Biblical narratives

## Background
This documentation site grew out of years of Biblical study and theological research. We believe that Scripture provides clear evidence about the nature of Jesus Christ that contradicts Islamic teachings on key points.

Our approach is rooted in the belief that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man, as revealed in Scripture, and that this truth is fundamental to understanding Biblical teachings.

## Core Values

### Biblical Truth
We are committed to accurately representing what Scripture teaches, even when it challenges popular narratives or interpretations.

### Scholarly Integrity
While we take a clear position on these theological matters, we strive to be fair in our representation of different viewpoints and to engage with opposing perspectives respectfully.

### Accessibility
We aim to make complex theological concepts understandable to readers regardless of their background in Biblical studies.
